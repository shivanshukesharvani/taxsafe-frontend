You are a Senior Frontend Engineer + UX Designer. Update the EXISTING React frontend to make it a production-polished, INTERACTIVE, USER-FRIENDLY, LIGHT 3D WEB APP with smooth 3D-style animations and professional color system. This is for a fintech/hackathon startup product (Tax Filing Mistake Checker). Preserve all current pages and flow (Landing → Question Wizard → Upload → Processing → Result). DO NOT add backend logic or new features—only UI/UX, styling, microinteractions, and motion.

========================
MISSION (short)
========================
Make the app look & feel like a trustworthy fintech startup:
- Clean modern layout
- Professional color palette
- Subtle 3D depth for components
- Smooth, performant animations
- Best-in-class CTAs & microcopy for conversions
- Mobile first + accessible

========================
DESIGN SYSTEM (exact)
========================
Use these tokens (HEX):
- Primary (Deep Navy): #0B2545
- Accent (Soft Blue): #1E90FF
- Accent-2 (Indigo): #3B82F6
- Background: #F6F8FA
- Surface / Card: #FFFFFF
- Muted text: #65708A
- Success (Green): #1FA463
- Warning (Yellow): #F2C94C
- Danger (Red): #E74C3C

Typography & spacing:
- Font stack: "Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial"
- Base font-size 16px, generous line-height
- Use consistent spacing scale (8/16/24/32)

========================
3D & MOTION RULES (safe, subtle)
========================
- Use CSS 3D transforms + Framer Motion for transitions.
- Card hover: transform: translateY(-8px) scale(1.01) rotateX(1.5deg); box-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(11,37,69,0.08)
- Container perspective: 1000px
- Animation durations: 200–350ms; easing: cubic-bezier(.2,.9,.3,1)
- Use will-change: transform for animated elements
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: provide reduced/none animations
- NO heavy 3D libs (Three.js only allowed if tiny, but prefer CSS+Framer)

========================
INTERACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS
========================
- Smooth page/step transitions (AnimatePresence / Framer Motion)
- Buttons: hover lift, active press (scale .98), focus visible outline
- Progress bar: animated width with ease
- File upload: drag-and-drop with hover glow and microbounce on drop
- Processing screen: sequential status lines that fade in; accessible aria-live updates
- Result page: risk badge with entrance scale + glow; issue cards expand/collapse with height animation

========================
BEST CTA & MICROCOPY (use exactly or adapt)
========================
Primary CTA (Landing & top of wizard):
- Text: **“Check My Filing — 2 min”**
- Style: Primary deep navy background with subtle gradient overlay using Accent Blue; white text; rounded 10px; drop shadow; hover lift
- Rationale: Communicates speed + action.

Secondary CTA (less prominent):
- Text: **“See Example Report”**
- Style: outlined with Accent Blue border, hover fill

Microcopy guidelines:
- Keep it plain language (no tax jargon)
- Examples:
  - Hero subtext: “Find common filing mistakes in minutes — avoid notices and delays.”
  - Upload hint: “Optional — upload salary slip or Form 26AS to improve accuracy.”
  - Processing lines: “Analyzing your answers…”, “Checking for common mismatches…”

========================
PAGE SPECIFICS (how to update existing screens)
========================
Landing:
- Add subtle abstract SVG background shape (low opacity)
- CTA with badge showing average time (2 min)
- Add small trust row (e.g., “Used by students & professionals”)

Question Wizard:
- Card centered with depth; one question per screen
- Animated step transitions with progress indicator
- Next disabled until answer chosen

Upload:
- Drag zone with animated outline & subtle 3D lift on hover
- Show filename pill with small trash remove icon + microanimation on remove

Processing:
- Centered animated loader with step text; use aria-live=polite
- Auto-transition to result after simulated delay (2–3s) for demo

Result:
- Prominent 3D RiskBadge (Green/Yellow/Red) — animate on mount
- Issue cards stacked with small z-index lift; expand for details
- Primary CTA to “Download Report (PDF)” placeholder (non-functional) styled as primary CTA

========================
ACCESSIBILITY & PERFORMANCE
========================
- High contrast ratios (WCAG AA)
- Keyboard operable: tab order, enter/space activation
- aria-labels for interactive controls, aria-live for processing
- Lazy-load images & SVGs
- Keep bundle small; prefer CSS transforms to layout thrashing

========================
DEV RULES (what agent should output)
========================
- Update existing components — do not rewrite app structure
- Use CSS Modules or scoped CSS files (component.module.css)
- Use Framer Motion for animations (or CSS if Framer not available)
- Add CSS variables for color tokens
- Add small /src/design-tokens.css or variables.css with the tokens above..
